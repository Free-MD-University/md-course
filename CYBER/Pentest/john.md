we can unshadow a shadow file with :

unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow

the result will be a text that jowhn can read with

john --wordlist={path to wordlist} --rules {path to unshadow file}


to use john with ssh see ssh.md

see all possible hash are :
https://hashcat.net/hashcat/

see hash discovery : https://hashes.com/en/tools/hash_identifier / https://www.tunnelsup.com/hash-analyzer/

you can use crackstation for not salt poassword


# crack hash
john --list=formats
john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashes.txt


# salt 
the salt need to be in the password . in general it defined in the format of the hash :

for bcrypt $**$SALT$ john will find this alone 

# hashcat 

hashcat can found hash too : see https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=hashcat for list of all hash .

we need to use 

hashcat -m {hash_code} hashfile wordlist

# salt 
the salt need to be in the password . in general it defined in the format of the hash :

for sha1 is pass:salt

we can see how put hash on: https://github.com/unstable-deadlock/brashendeavours.gitbook.io/blob/master/pentesting-cheatsheets/hashcat-hash-modes.md

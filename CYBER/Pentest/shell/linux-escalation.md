to execute an escalation in linux we have multiple choice :

# find a CVRE :

the CVRE can be found according to the os version (uname -a)/(cat /proc/version)/ (/etc/issue).
a exploit can be found and runned.
the fact to find info is called enumeration

# sudo

the sudo allow us to run as system admin a command .
some command can be allowed for special user to be run as root with sudo

the sudo -l allow us to check which command the actual user can be send with sudo .

the find command can be executed with sudo and -exec to find what we want.

# suid

some executable have a special suid that mean that the owner of the app is a special user .

to see their special permission we can run :
find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null

a little s will be diplayed for special program with suid

for exemple run this give me on my machine
1722 44 -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 43352 Sep 5 2019 /usr/bin/base64

so we can use to display info

# capabilities :

some executable have a highter level of permission they are named capabilities.

getcap -r / 2> /dev/null

that ocmmand list all available capabilities.
we can find in GTFObins some payload to run to get sudo

# path

the path allow to override capacities if we have access to a folder within path we can create a binary set SUID and call the binary.
cat 
# nfs system

nfs system can be a writable share too .
we can create a file with suid bit put too and gain access to root .

with the showmount command we cann see all mounted volume.
and with the /etc/exports we search mount colume with no_squash options.

after mount the volume 


# cron jobs

we can use a cron who run on a deleted shell to create a shell in the path and get a reverse shell
put cat /etc/crontab

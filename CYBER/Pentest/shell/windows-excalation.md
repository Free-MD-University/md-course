C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend.xml
C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend\Unattend.xml
C:\Windows\system32\sysprep.inf
C:\Windows\system32\sysprep\sysprep.xml

these file are default for admin that install a lot of wondows machine.

an another way is to find in the console history if a user send the command in the historey

type %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt

some creadentail are saved by windows and can be used by anyone.
this not give us the password but we can run the machine with root

runas /savecred /user:admin cmd.exe

other way to do that :

# scheduled jobs :

schtasks

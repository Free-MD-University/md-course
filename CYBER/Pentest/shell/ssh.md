# ssh with rsa key 

when a rsa start with : 
Proc-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED
DEK-Info: AES-128-CBC,6ABA7DE35CDB65070B92C1F760E2FE75

we can use john to decrypt. first we need to find the hash of the password 

```bash
ssh2john cle_rsa > decrypted_hash_file

```

ensuite on peut utiliiser john to decrypt the password : 

```bash
john --wordlist={path to wordlist} decrypted_hash_file
```

# uncript ssh passkwy

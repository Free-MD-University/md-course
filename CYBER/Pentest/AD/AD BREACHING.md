# Get NTLM Credential 

to get credentials there is 2 options (I made a special room for it): 
- OSINT
- PHISHING


# NTLM 
NTLM is a protocol to authentificate someone in AD . 
some service use a heavy protocol of authentification to allow the use to make the action . 
these service can be connected to intenernet .


## BRUTE FORCE 

we can use brute force to auth to a web service . 

hydra or a python script can do it easily .


# LDAP 

LDAP is an authentification (open source) compatible with AD .

## LDAP Pass-back attack 

to do this attack we modify the LDAP server to get a reverse connection to use om port of LDAP (389).

# SMB 

used for file sharing.

## MIM 
the best attack for SMB is MIM attack to get the AUTH challenge.
To do that we can use Responder a githubtool that will poinson. the response can be found in :
git@github.com:lgandx/Responder.git
the responder will give use an username and PAssword in the netwrok .

we can hack the hasj with hashcat 

hashcat -m 56000 {hash found file} {password list}

# MDT SMMC
Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) us a service to help

 manage. it installed in SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager).

# PXE BOOT :
allow to install the OS dictly from the OS. the dhcp allow to get the new host and the host can sownload the PXE IMAGE.
we can find the server where are stored the pxe iage and retrive them. from these image we can retrieve the credential of the image. 
from the cbd file we can find the location of the wim file witj
Get-WimFile -bcdFile .\conf.bcd

from the wim file we can :
Get-FindCredentials -WimFile pxeboot.wim

when we have a config in AD we can search in config file to search password. 


# MCaffe
we can find in Mccaffe db (C:/ProgramData/McAfee/Agent/DB/ma.db) this file can be opened in sqlite 

# Permission Delegation
we  can delegate some function to other user like ACL named Access Control Entries (ACEs) that populate Discretionary Access Control Lists (DACLs). 
for exemple giving to ForceChangePassword ACE over the Domain Users group to a standard user that lead to change password of Admin and escalate privilege .
there is some ACL To check like :
- ForceChangePassword: We have the ability to set the user's current password without knowing their current password.
- AddMembers: We have the ability to add users (including our own account), groups or computers to the target group.
- GenericAll: We have complete control over the object, including the ability to change the user's password, register an SPN or add an AD object to the target group.
GenericWrite: We can update any non-protected parameters of our target object. This could allow us to, for example, update the scriptPath parameter, which would cause a script to execute the next time the user logs on.
- WriteOwner: We have the ability to update the owner of the target object. We could make ourselves the owner, allowing us to gain additional permissions over the object.
- WriteDACL: We have the ability to write new ACEs to the target object's DACL. We could, for example, write an ACE that grants our account full control over the target object.
- AllExtendedRights: We have the ability to perform any action associated with extended AD rights against the target object. This includes, for example, the ability to force change a user's password.

bloodhund will allow us to hceck these ACL more easily 


# Kerberos Delegation
 Kerberos Delegation is to enable an application to access resources

 ## Constrained vs Unconstrained vs (RBCD)

 Constrained Delegation restricts what services an account can like http,MSSQL ... 
 Unconstrained Delegation give access to everything .
 Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD) once again provided additional restrictions on Kerberos Delegation for security

we need to find the version and the system of the db: 
We can use nmap to do so : nmap -A -T4 -p 3306,3389,445,139,135 10.10.47.103

type of sql injection : 
# in band: 
check the result directly in the db
- Error-Based SQL Injection: The attacker manipulates the SQL query to produce error messages from the database. contain information about the database structure,
- Union-Based SQL Injection : The attacker uses the UNION SQL operator to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements into a single result, thereby retrieving data from other tables
# Inferential :
stead, the attacker sends payloads and observes the application’s behaviour and response times to infer information about the database
 Boolean-Based Blind SQL Injection: The attacker sends an SQL query to the database, forcing the application to return a different result based on a true or false condition
# out of band
Out-of-band SQL injection is used when the attacker cannot use the same channel to launch the attack and gather results or when the server responses are unstable. This technique relies on the database server making an out-of-band request (e.g., HTTP or DNS) to send the query result to the attacker.


The main goal is to remove FE validation response because when using a SQL injection the response will be differen forn the base payload. 

# Filter evasion : 
we today have many filter evasion : this not allow the input to insert sql weird charactere. 
but we have a lot of encoding taht you can use for exemple base64 or other.
we can use no quote evasion 

### OR and and escape
or value is ||  and and &&. we can remplace these values

### concat 
we can use CONCAT function to insert a value .

### /**/
when no space is allowed we can use /**/ that remplace the space char .

### Char Utter/Lower
we can by pass filter with char sensitive . if SELECT is filtered so Select or SeLeCt can be used .


# Out Od Band 

the goal is to use another channel to get or send the data . 
load_file or OUTFILE os

allow to do a request to a website by the server.
the hacker can chosse the website where the server go.

we can use a get request paramater to send the url and our choice and remove the last part as a new parameter like

from :
https://{website}.website.thm/api/item?id=2

website give :
server.website.thm/flag?id=9&test=

give :

https://website.thm/item/2?server=server.website.thm/flag?id=9&test=

we can protect by doing the following :

Deny list : remove not authorized url. but a hacker can create a fake website with a new url

Allow list : accept only some url but here we can create a subdomain to authorized website

Open Redirect : create a authorized website that redirect to a unauthroized one .

# Command Injection 
a command injection is when a backend allow us to run a command shell with user input.

there is 2 way to detect command injeciton : 

## blind :
no direct output of the response shell need to investigate to know if that worked.

for exemple we can use ping or sleep that will take the response of the server the time put in the parameter .


## Verbose :
have the output response of the shell .
here is more easy to know if it worked we have directly the output in the web page.


# avoid
to avoid these problem we can use :

## Input Sanitisation :

chekc the user input and not let him use some word .

## Output Sanitisation: 
check the shell output and let only what you want to give.
for exemple you can filter the output to be only number but the attacker can convert the output in hexadecimal format .

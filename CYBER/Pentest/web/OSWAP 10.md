# BOLA / IDOR: 

this is misconfiguration api allowing to query secret info wihtout authorization 


# BUA
misconfiguration API allowing to get authentificated with bad infos .

# Excessive Data Exposure 

when a API send more that eneded infos . 

# Lac Of Ressource 

if we don't implement a rate limit a user can easily try to hack the server and make a DDOS attack . 


## Identification & Auth Failure

if the password is too weak or the system let brute force attack, or cookie auth weak system.

## re-registering user :

if the dev make an mistake in the code, you can re register an user with an already used username/mail but with a space at the start, in this case you will create a new userbut kept the right of the old user.

# Software Integrity :

when we download a software we can download a malware and not the real software .
to be sure to download the real file a hash is given with the file to be sure.
the hash take the binary if the file downloaded and check after a specific function,
that the result is the same that the hash .

# Auth Integrity :

## API Auth

## Session:

course on API

## JWT:

course on API

### JWT with None Integrity:

inside JWT there is a signature algorithm that sign the payload with a secret key,
because the secret key is private only the user of the private key can change the body, but in old version of JWT there was no signature.
in this case we can change the information like we want .

# SSRF: Server-Side Request Forgery

If a server make a request to another web site (with the admin auth of the server).
If you can define where the server send his request you can redirect the request to your own server and get the auth parameter of the server .

take an exeple of a request :
http://server.com/request?server=file-server
that send a request to file-server/file

we can use to get access to localhost by putting server=localhost/admin%3F
in this way the server will send localhost/admin?/file of the url and get access.
 

# Mass  Update

when updating data from endpoint .
some update are not check the json sent and update the db with the json sended.
we can exploit it by changing no wanted data like password or other ...

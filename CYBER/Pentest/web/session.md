# seesion 
because http is stateless the session need to be created and handled differently . 

## Cookie 
 store inside a cookie a session id with expiration handle by the browser

## JWT 
  put inside header in request byt he code if client side a JWT token 
### fail
#### no test for signature 
if the api work event if the signature is removed (need to have the last dot) so you can send what you want inside the JWT . go to JWT io and change what you want 
#### downgrade to None
if the dev allow multiple signature we can try to change the header to get none alg. we can use cyberchef with base64 encode and decode on the header part. 
#### Signature Algorithm Confusion
if we can downgrade from asymetric to symetric. some library use the public key for checking the signature . and because the public key is known (not secure in general). we can create our own signature .
#### brute force 
hashcat -m 16500 -a 0 jwt.txt jwt.secrets.list
#### no expiry 
if no expiry is in the JWT you can try to get one JWT .

# leak:
## Application Leaking the 2FA Token
If an application handles data poorly or has vulnerabilities like insecure API endpoints, it might accidentally leak the 2FA token in the application's HTTP response.

## Brute force OTP
Even though OTPs are designed for one-time use, they aren't immune to brute-force attacks. If an attacker can make unlimited guesses, they might eventually get the correct OTP, especially if the OTP isn't well protected by additional security measures.Without proper rate limiting, an application is open to attackers to keep trying different OTPs without difficulty. If an attacker can submit multiple guesses in a short amount of time, it increases the likelihood that the attacker will be able to get the correct OTP.

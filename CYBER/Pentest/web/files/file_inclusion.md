# Local File Inclusion

the goal of file inclusion is to get file of a system .
in some sytem we request a file and the path to the file is in the parameter,
so we can help to get the file we want / REC.
let try the include function of php : we give an incorect file the error launched show us the path of the file searched.
if a user let a function that read a file we can use file transversal to get the file wanted even a system file like ../../etc/passwd and get all password .

# Remote File Inclusion

here we inject a web file into the server. we don't send a path to give a local file only a http path to a file

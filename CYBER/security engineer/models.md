when enter in an enterprise we need to create a diagram of vulnerabilties : 
to do so we start by doing : 

# Hight Level Overview : 

## Asset Identification
map all org arch and dependencies 

## Identify Threats
identify threat from the map

## Analyse Vulnerabilities and Prioritise Risks 

analyze vulnerabilities and note them.


# Attack Trees

defining how an attack can be performed. 

# MITRE ATT&CK Framework

a list of technique to avoid cyber attack : 

some of technique to prioritize are : 
Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190) / Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (T1068) / Data from Cloud Storage (T1530)  / Network Denial of Service (T1498)

we can use the matrix website of Mitre to check each technique, prioritize them and see the advancement .

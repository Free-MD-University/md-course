# Risk

when dealing with risk we need to define : 
- risk acceptance :  accept that there is a risk 
- risk reduction :  make this risk at minimal possible without impact
- risk avoidance : remove the risk even if there is impact

## Risk Assement Methodology 

there are a lot of risk assement methodology like NIST SP 800-30 or Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA).

###  NIST SP 800-30 : 
1) Frame risk: First, we must establish the context within which all risk activities occur.
2) Assess risk: We must identify, analyse, and evaluate potential risks and their likelihood and impact. This step is crucial to help decide on a proper response later.
3) Respond to risk: We need to take the steps necessary to mitigate the likelihood or impact of the risk. The response depends on many factors, and we will cover them separately.
4) Monitor risk: Finally, we continue tracking and evaluating the effectiveness of risk responses, identifying new risks, and ensuring that our risk management activities are effective. Monitoring is an ongoing process, as many criteria might change over time.


a risk need to be handle according : 
- his impact 
- his possiblity to occur 

when you need to buy something for a risk we need to say : 
- what will be the cost of the loss 
- what this thing will give me and how much I estimate the loss 
- decide if this a good price for the risk .

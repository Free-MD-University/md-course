the IDS allow to check maliscious activity inside a network by exemple if someone make a legitimate network connection than the firewall allow and after make weird activity .

there is two category of IDS

-   Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) :
    based on each host hard to maintain in large network because need to manage host by host .

-   Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS):
    network based solutions each request route by it.

to detect thread the IDS have 3 way :

-   signature based :
    each malware / threat / shell have a unique id. this id is stocked in a DB that the IDS
    used to detect threat. can't detect zero-day exploit.

-   Anomaly based :
    each threat is identified by anomalie command / behavior

-   hybrid based :
    merge of the two way.

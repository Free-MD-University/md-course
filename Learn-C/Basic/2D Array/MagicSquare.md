# MagicSquare

1) Create a code with a 2 Dimensional Array of int that the user need to fill (We estimate that the user fill only with number no need to check if the user prompt is correct), the array will have a size of NxN (N is a constant that you can easily change in the code)
2) Check if the array is a [magicCube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square)
3) Done !

# CGNAT:

Carrier-Grade Network Address Translation (CGNAT) is a networking technology that allows multiple users on a network to share a single public IPv4 address. It's a way for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and large-scale networks to conserve limited public IPv4 addresses and manage IPv4 resources effectively while transitioning towards IPv6.
It like a nat of our ISP, in some way you're doing a nat(ISP) of nat(you're home) .
